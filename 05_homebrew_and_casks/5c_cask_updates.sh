### asking password upfront
###

# solution 1
# only working for sudo commands, not for commands that need a password and are run without sudo
# and only works for specified time
# asking for the administrator password upfront
#sudo -v
# keep-alive: update existing 'sudo' time stamp until script is finished
#while true; do sudo -n true; sleep 600; kill -0 "$$" || exit; done 2>/dev/null &

# solution 2
# working for all commands that require the password (use sudo -S for sudo commands)
# working until script is finished or exited

# function for reading secret string (POSIX compliant)
enter_password_secret()

    # read -s is not POSIX compliant
    #read -s -p "Password: " SUDOPASSWORD
    #echo ''

    # disabling echo, this will prevent showing output

    trap 'stty echo' EXIT
    # asking for password
    printf "Password: "
    # reading secret
    read -r "$@" SUDOPASSWORD
    # reanabling echo

    printf "\n"
    # making sure builtin bash commands are used for using the SUDOPASSWORD, this will prevent showing it in ps output
    # has to be part of the function or it wouldn`t be updated during the maximum three tries
