restore keychain
if you change to new hardware and restore your old keychain macos does not use the old keychain but sets up a new one due to a new hardware id
backup old keychain as zip (login.keychain-db)
reset keychain as explained above
unzip and keep a copy of the old keychain zip backup
move the old keychain to /Users/$USER/Library/Keychains or a newly created subdirectory
open "/Applications/Utilities/Keychain Access.app"
drag and drop the old keychain in the upper left corner area where login/local objects/system/system roots is located
copy all entries from the old to the new keychain or keep both

important: when deleting a keychain from upper left corner area the keychain file itself gets deleted, too. This is due to the keychain being not copied, but referenced as a link. That`s why a copy as zip should be kept as long as the old keychain is needed.
